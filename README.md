# AppPrototype
_Imade_ is an app prototype I created in Adobe XD for my Human Computer Interaction & Affective Computing course. In _Imade_ the customer can easily search different small business through filters, follow their favourite shops, rate and review them and their products, and directly purchase from the app. My app _Imade_ incorporates all the pros of other platforms and allows for all kinds of small businesses to be found.

For more infromation about my prototype and the user testing analysis I did, read my report **Alisa_Todorova_report_HCI22.pdf**.
